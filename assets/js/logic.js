WHEN I click the start button a timer starts and I am presented with a question

WHEN I answer a question I am presented with another question

WHEN I answer a question incorrectly time is subtracted from the clock

WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0 the game is over

WHEN the game is over I can save my initials and score
