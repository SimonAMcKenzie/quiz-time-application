# Quiz Time Application

## Description

As a coding boot camp student, I developed the Quiz Time Application to test my knowledge of JavaScript fundamentals in a timed quiz format. The primary goal is to allow users to take a timed quiz, answer questions, and store high scores. This helps in gauging individual progress compared to peers.

## Acceptance Criteria

For this challenege I followed the acceptance criteria below:

- **Given** I am taking a code quiz
- **When** I click the start button
- **Then** a timer starts, and I am presented with a question
- **When** I answer a question
- **Then** I am presented with another question
- **When** I answer a question incorrectly
- **Then** time is subtracted from the clock
- **When** all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
- **Then** the game is over
- **When** the game is over
- **Then** I can save my initials and score
